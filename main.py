# Here, it is assumed that there is an array predictions containing predictions from the neural network for each time period
# It is also assumed that there is an initial portfolio balance portfolio_balance and a certain risk per trade risk_per_trade
# Loop through the predictions and call the manage_portfolio function for each prediction
for prediction in predictions:

# Step 7: Integration with the exchange
# Using relevant APIs to place orders and retrieve data

# Step 8: Developing a graphical interface

# Step 9: Ensuring security
# Implementing authentication and encryption mechanisms to ensure data security

# Step 10: Monitoring and updating
# Developing performance monitoring mechanisms and regularly updating the neural network model

# Other additional components and functions
# Implementing any additional components and functions that may be required for the application
